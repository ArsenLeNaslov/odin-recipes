    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Chocolate Cake's Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> <!-- unordered list of necessary ingredients -->
        <li><strong>All purposes flour</strong>, 3 cups. The unbleached one works the best</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa Powder</strong>, ⅔rd of a cup</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUA-yWljlQ&ab_channel=PonAdidas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Exsqueeze me, a Baking Powder?</strong></a> 1 ½ teaspoons</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>, 1 ½ tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>, 1 ½ teaspoons</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>, 2 ¼ cups. Maple syrup is fine in this cake if you want to stay away from artificial sugars</li>
        <li><strong>Instant Coffee Granules</strong>, 1 tablespoon, optional</li>
        <li><strong>16 tablespoon or 1 cup vegan butter</strong>, or oil can be used instead. Use any unflavored vegetable oil but not coconut oil because the flavour would not work well here</li>
        <li><strong>Vegan Yogurt</strong>, ½ cup, optional. You can use non-dairy milk, including soy milk or oat milk. Yogurt, however, adds a lovely tenderness to cake so use it if you can</li>
        <li><strong>1 ¾th cups water</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>, 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li><strong>Pure Vanilla extract</strong>, 2 teaspoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chocolate Buttercream Frosting's Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> <!-- unordered list of necessary ingredients -->
        <li><strong>1 Cup Vegan Butter</strong>, 16 tablespoons or 2 sticks</li>
        <li><strong>Powdered or Confectioners' Sugar</strong>, 2 cups or maple syrup</li>
        <li><strong>Pure Vanilla extract</strong>, ½ cup</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa Powder</strong>, ⅔rd of a cup</li>
        <li><strong>Semisweet Chocholat Chips</strong>, 1 cup. Optional but recommended</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps - How to make it</h2>
    <ol> <!-- ordered list of necessary steps to follow -->
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong>at 190° C / 375° F. Prepare two eight or nine-inch cake tins by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and then greasing and flouring them.
            <br>It helps to add a touch of cooking spray before you place the parchment paper into the tin to help it adhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Sift the flour</strong>, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cocoa powder into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Dump in the remaining cake ingredients</strong>, vegan yogurt, water, vinegar, vegetable oil, sugar, pure vanilla extract and cofee, if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk for a few seconds</strong>, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula, and continue mixing for just a few more seconds until you have a smooth batter. Don't overmi</li>
        <li><strong>Divide the batter equally between the two cake pans</strong>, place in the preheated oven and bake 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cakes cool in the pans for around 30 minutes</strong>, then slide a knife along the sides to loosen, invert each cake into a plate, turn right side up, and continue cooling on the rack.
            <br>These cakes are fairly sturdy but always be careful when handling baked cakes, especially if you are new to this.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Make the Frosting</h2>
    <ol> <!-- ordered list of necessary steps to follow -->
        <li><strong>Place the chocolate chips</strong> in a bowl over a simmering pot of water. Stir a couple of times with a spatula until they are completely melted and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Place the softened butter in a bowl</strong> with the cacao powder and vanilla. Beat with a hand mixer or in a stand mixer until mixed and creamy, then begin whisking in the sugar, half a cup at a time.
            <br>I like mixing it slightly with the spatula before I start the hand mixer to ensure it doesn't fly all over the place when I start the hand mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir in the melted chocolate and beat until mixed</strong>, if using maple syrup instead of sugar, and if the frosting splits, refrigerate it for 30 minutes before beating in the melted chocolate.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost the cake</strong></li>
    </ol>
