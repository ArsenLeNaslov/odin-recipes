    <h2>Steps - How to make it</h2>
    <ol> <!-- ordered list of necessary steps to follow -->
        <li><strong>Place olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven</strong>, add onions, carrots and celery and season with salt and ground black pepper. Turn heat to medium and saute the veggies for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the garlic</strong>, bay leaves, rosemary and oregano.</li>
        <li><strong>Continue to saute the veggies</strong> until they are almost soft, about five minutes. Don't let them brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir in the tomato paste and tomato puree and mix</strong>, add paprika or red pepper flakes. Mix and bring the sauce to a boil. Lower heat and simmer five minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir in the drained chickpeas</strong>, along with four cups mushroom stock (or water). Mix well and bring back to a boil. Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the pasta and mix it in</strong>, bring to a boil and let the pasta simmer in the broth until al dente (it should take about the same time as it would if you cooked the pasta separately). Stir a few times to make sure the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom, and add more water if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Once the pasta has cooked, turn off the heat</strong>, he sauce will continue to thicken as it stands. Serve hot or warm with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some <a href="https://holycowvegan.net/vegan-cashew-parmesan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>vegan cashew parmesan cheese</em></strong></a>.</li>
