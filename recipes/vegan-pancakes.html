    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Looking for a change from your usual diet? Well then, let's try out a vegan lasagna, shall we? This bad boy will taste exactly like a traditional one, but it is meatless and dairy-free.
        <br>"Healthy Pancakes" sounds like an oxymoron? Let's be honest, even so, they are irresistable, and this recipe is the proof confirming both.
        <br>They are fluffy, tender and come together so quickly. You need just over 5 minutes to put the batter together and minutes later they are ready to be served.
        <br>Serve them with a pat of <a href="https://holycowvegan.net/vegan-butter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>vegan butter</em></strong></a> and mable syrup, or top them with fruits and <a href="https://holycowvegan.net/how-to-make-vegan-lemon-curd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>vegan lemon curd</em></strong></a>, the options are endless!</p>
    
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Griddle</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> <!-- unordered list of necessary ingredients -->
        <li><strong>Whole wheat pastry flour</strong>, 1 ½ cups. or a mix of regular whole wheat flour and all purposes flour. Try using all whole wheat pastry flour because it gives you tremendous flavor and nutrition</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUA-yWljlQ&ab_channel=PonAdidas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Exsqueeze me, a Baking Powder?</strong></a> 1 ½ teaspoons</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>, 1 ½ tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>, ¼ teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Dairy Milk</strong>, 1 ½ cups. Almond is among my favourites, Oat, Soy, Cashew are all fine here</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>, 2 tablespoons. Helps create a "buttermilk" effect in the pancakes, making them light and fluffy</li>
        <li><strong>Flaxmeal</strong>, 2 tablespoons. Adds more heart-healthy fiber and nutrition and is a great replacement for eggs in this recipe</li>
        <li><strong>Maple Syrup</strong>, or any other vegan sweetener, including sugar and agave, are fine. 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Pure Vanilla Extract</strong>, 2 teaspoon. Optional to add more flavour</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>, 6 teaspoons</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps - How to make it</h2>
    <ol> <!-- ordered list of necessary steps to follow -->
        <li><strong>In a bowl</strong>, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>In a another bowl</strong>, add the nondairy milk and apple cider vinegar. Let it stand for a couple of minutes, then add the flax meal and water and whisk well. Add the maple syrup and vanilla extract and mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients to the dry mix</strong> with a spatula or the whisk until everything just comes together. The batter should still be lumpy but you shouldn't have any obvious patches of dry flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat a nonstick or cast-iron griddle</strong>, then pray with cooking spray or coat lightly with oil. Then</li>
        <ol> <!-- sub-ordered list of furhter necessary steps to follow -->
            <li>Using a ⅓rd cup measure, scoop up the batter and pour on the hot griddle.</li>
            <li>Cook until bubbles appear at the top of the pancake and the underside is golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Flip over and cook the other side until it is lightly browned as well.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Serve hot</strong> with fruits and maple syrup, or other toppings of your choice!</li>
    </ol>
