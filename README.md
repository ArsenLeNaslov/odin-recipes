# odin-recipes
First Odin Project exercise featuring HTML code recreating a basic website hosting cooking recipes 

This is the 1st project taken from Odin Project's Foundations Course. It consists in recreating a basic website hosting cooking recipes, by using GitHub, Git - Command Line and basic HTML. It was helpful to review some basic Git and HTML skills, exploring basic GitHub functionalities, and how to put everything together to create a functional website.

Skills covered:
• Public Repository creation on GitHub
• Connecting it to my local machine using Git (git clone command combined with the GitHub's Repository's SSH Key)
• Add new directories and files hierarchically with commands such as mkdir and touch
• Launch VS Code from CLI (with code command) and built the HTML structure for each page
• Use the correct HTML boilerplate (! then Enter) with markups and tags to add: 
- titles headings (h1 and h2) 
- descriptions in paragraphs (p) 
- undordered and ordered lists (ul and ol, featuring li) 
- links (a href="" target="_self" or "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer") 
- images (img src="" alt="" height="" width="" border="") 
- line breaks (br) 
- text styling (strong and em)
• Commit the changes to GitHub from VSCode (set as Git Editor) adding commit messages (Subject and Body)
• Push changes to GitHub
• Publish project from GitHub to make the website publicly available
